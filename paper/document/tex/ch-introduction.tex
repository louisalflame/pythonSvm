\section{Motivation}

Web Applications become more and more indispensable in our life.
People can easily get informations with the development of the Internet.
It becomes more convenient for people to search new knowledge, buy goods and chat with friends.
People spent lots of time on the Internet for working, studying, shopping, socialozong and playing.
As the result, more engineers tend to develop the applications on the Internet.
On the other hand, Mobile Applications is also a choice for software developer.
People can carry smart phone and enjoy the applications everywhere.
Although people can visit web applications by browser on the smart phone,
a special mobile application has a better performance.
Companies may develop the applications on both the Internet and the mobiles.
For instance, Google and Facebook.

In order to guarantee the performance and user experience of the applications,
the testing of the applications is required.
However, the current techniques of testing take lots of works and times.
Because the applications are complex and dynamic,
they have different reaction with different inputs.
Engineers need to write the test scripts case by case according to each functions.
they also need basic knowledge of software testing.
To reduce the work time of testing, the automated testing become essential for engineers.
But the challenge is it is too difficult to generate test case on black box testing.
Without the detailed information of functions,
We may not know how to make a test script.

\section{Purpose}

In this paper, we propose a technique to automatically generating traces on dynamic web applications.
The program named WebTraceCollector can collect the informations on web page and try to guess the suitable inputs.
We construct a inputs databank with some examples of inputs,
so the program will find a similar example as the input value of web page.
With the suggested input values,
the program can explore the website automatically and build the finite state machine to represent the website,
and generate the traces for testing.


In order to automatically evaluate traces collected from web and mobile applications,
we propose a teachnique to transform the traces into standard format.
We constrcut a label dictionary, which collects common sense of action and screen from applications,
so the traces can be expressed in a standard vector of labels.
Then, we use the method of machine learning to evaluate traces.
We use SVM to classify the traces into passed traces and failed traces.

\section{Organization}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Chapter 2 shows the related work, 
and we introduce the tool for generating mobile traces and the method used for evaluating in Chapter 3.
In Chapter 4, we propose a technique to generate traces on dynamic web applications.
Chapter 5 shows the framework to evaluate traces from the web and mobiles.
Then, the experiment results shown on the Chapte 6,
and the conclusion in Chapter 7.
