In the recent days, the Intertnet is becoming more popular.
A wide range of web applications have been developed.
People spent lots of time on Internet.
Thus, it becomes an important problem to verify the web applications to developers.
In this paper, we propose a tool for automated web testing.
The developers do not need to write the test scripts.
The tool can explore the dynamic webpages by clicking buttons and insert values and record the test traces.
We propose a system to construct test oracle of web applications and mobile applications using the support vector machines.
The system extracts features from the traces and builds aa predictive model to classify the passed traces and failed traces.
With the automated testing tool and system,
we can effectively reduce human cost to achieve the purpose of automated testing.
